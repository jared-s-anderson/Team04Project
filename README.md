# Overview

This repository is a simple math JRPG written in python using the Pygame library.

This game is intended for elementary students who want to increase their math skills. 

### How to Play: 

The player is automatically placed in the first map and has to solve the math problems shown.
If they answer correctly, their level increases (shown on the bottom right corner of the screen) and they deal damage to the enemy closest to them. The player can move on to the next map once they defeat all the enemies of the current map.
